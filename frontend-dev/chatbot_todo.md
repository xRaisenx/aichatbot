# Chatbot To-Do List
This to-do list outlines tasks to complete or enhance the chatbot interface for [planetbeauty.com](httpswww.planetbeauty.com), styled with Tailwind CSS. The chatbot, named Bella, is a responsive, lower-right positioned chatbox with userAI messages, a product card (with Shop Now, Add to Cart, and Reason for Match), and a thinking animation. Tasks are written to be clear and actionable for AI or developers.
## To-Do Tasks

Finalize Chatbox Styling

 Position chatbox in the lower-right corner, fixed to viewport.
 Style toggle button as a pink circle (#F9E8E8) with chat icon.
 Make chatbox collapsible (hidden by default, expands to 400px wide600px tall on desktop).
 Add a subtle opening animation (e.g., scale-up) when toggle is clicked.


Enhance Header

 Add Bella’s name and avatar in header with soft pink background (#F9E8E8).
 Include a close button with gray icon (#E5E7EB).
 Replace placeholder avatar (httpsvia.placeholder.com32) with a custom Bella avatar.
 Add a minimize button next to close button for collapsing chatbox.


Polish User and AI Messages

 Style user messages Right-aligned, soft pink background (#F9E8E8).
 Style AI messages Left-aligned, light gray background (#E5E7EB), with Bella’s avatar.
 Add fade-in animation for new messages.
 Add timestamps to messages (e.g., “230 PM” in text-xs text-gray-500).
 Enable message copying with a hoverable copy icon.


Refine Bella Thinking Indicator

 Show three bouncing pink dots (#F9E8E8) when Bella is processing.
 Ensure animation is smooth and lightweight.
 Add a subtle text label (e.g., “Bella is thinking...”) next to dots in text-xs text-gray-600.


Optimize Product Card

 Include product image, name, price, Reason for Match, Shop Now (black #000000), and Add to Cart (soft pink #F9E8E8) buttons.
 Style Reason for Match as concise text (text-xs text-gray-600) below price.
 Ensure buttons stack vertically on mobile (media query for max-width 640px).
 Replace placeholder image (httpsvia.placeholder.com100) with real product images.
 Make Reason for Match dynamic (e.g., based on user input like “prefers hydrating products”).
 Add a loading state for buttons when clicked (e.g., spinning icon).


Improve Responsiveness

 Make chatbox full-widthheight on mobile (max-width 640px).
 Adjust font sizes and padding for mobile (e.g., text-xs for reason text).
 Use Tailwind’s responsive utilities (sm, md) for layout tweaks.
 Test on tablet sizes (e.g., 768px–1024px) to ensure smooth scaling.
 Add a mobile-specific close button in the input area for easier access.


Enhance Accessibility

 Add ARIA attributes (aria-label for buttons, aria-live for message area).
 Ensure high-contrast text (e.g., text-gray-800 on bg-white).
 Add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Enter to send message, Esc to close chatbox).
 Test with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to verify compatibility.


Test and Polish

 Test chatbot on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile browsers.
 Check performance (e.g., animation smoothness, load time with Tailwind CDN).
 Validate Reason for Match text readability and relevance on all devices.
 Collect user feedback to refine UIUX (e.g., button sizes, text clarity).
 Optimize Tailwind CSS by purging unused classes for faster load.


Prepare for Backend Integration

 Add a mock API call to simulate dynamic AI responses.
 Create a function to generate dynamic Reason for Match based on user input.
 Ensure product card data (image, name, price) can be populated from an API.


Future Enhancements

 Add quick reply buttons (e.g., “Show more products”, “Help with skincare”).
 Enable voice input for hands-free messaging.
 Support multilingual responses for broader accessibility.
 Implement dynamic theme detection to match sitewide theme.
