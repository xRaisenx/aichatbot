# Project Manager Feedback

## User Interface
- The chatbox interface is clean and minimalistic, which is good for focus.
- However, the input field could be larger to accommodate longer messages.
- The send button is intuitive, but it mights be better to allow sending messages with the Enter key.

## User Experience
- The chatbox responds quickly to user inputs, which is excellent.
- The conversation flow is smooth, with messages appearing in real-time.
- It would be nice to have a typing indicator when the other user is typing.

## Bugs or Issues
- Sometimes, messages are duplicated if sent too quickly.
- The chatbox doesn't scroll to the bottom automatically when new messages arrive.
- There is no way to delete or edit sent messages.

## Suggestions
- Add timestamps to messages for better context.
- Implement user avatars to distinguish between different users.
- Include an option to search through past messages.
- Consider adding support for multimedia messages, like images or videos.
