# Planet Beauty AI Chatbot: Intelligent Shopping Assistant

## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to the Planet Beauty AI Chatbot project! This isn't just a chatbot; it's an intelligent shopping assistant designed to revolutionize the online shopping experience for Planet Beauty customers. Built with cutting-edge AI and seamless e-commerce integration, this chatbot aims to provide personalized assistance, intelligent product recommendations, and instant answers, driving customer engagement and sales.

Our solution leverages the power of Google's Gemini API for sophisticated natural language understanding and Upstash Vector for lightning-fast, relevant product searches. Deep integration with Shopify ensures real-time product data accuracy and a smooth path from query to checkout.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Advanced Natural Language Conversations:** Understands complex user queries, intent, and context using a powerful integrated Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., xAI's Grok, OpenAI's GPT-4, or similar).
*   **Intelligent Product Search:** Utilizes Upstash Vector (BM25 sparse search) for quick and accurate product discovery.
*   **Shopify GraphQL Fallback:** Ensures product information is always available.
*   **Enhanced Contextual Chat History:**
    *   Remembers previous turns in the conversation.
    *   Utilizes LLM-powered summarization for long conversations to maintain relevant context efficiently.
*   **General Knowledge Base:** Answers general beauty-related questions (e.g., "What is skincare?") using a dedicated Upstash Vector index.
*   **External Data Integration:** Capable of fetching real-time data (e.g., product prices, trends) from external APIs to enrich responses (placeholder implementation).
*   **Real-time Product Sync:** Keeps product information up-to-date via Shopify Admin API.
*   **Efficient Caching & Rate Limiting:** Employs Upstash Redis for optimized performance and stability.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Built on Next.js and Vercel.
*   **Grok-like Personality:** AI responses are designed to be clear, concise, conversational, and slightly witty.

## üìà Business Value for Planet Beauty

*   **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Provides instant, 24/7 support and highly personalized, intelligent shopping guidance.
*   **Increased Sales Conversion:** Helps customers find the right products quickly and provides comprehensive information.
*   **Improved Customer Engagement:** Offers a more dynamic and knowledgeable interactive experience.
    *   **Reduced Support Load:** Automates responses to a wider range of common and complex queries.

## üåü Elevating the Beauty Shopping Experience: The Planet Beauty AI Assistant üåü

The Planet Beauty AI Chatbot is meticulously engineered to be more than just a virtual helper; it's poised to become the **ultimate intelligent shopping companion**, transforming how customers discover and connect with your products. Our vision is to provide an unparalleled, personalized, and efficient shopping journey for every Planet Beauty enthusiast.

**Why This AI Assistant Stands Out:**

*   **Deep Product Understanding:** Goes beyond simple keyword matching. Our AI, powered by Google's Gemini, comprehends complex queries, nuances in customer language (like "cheap sunscreen" or "serum for dry skin"), and the intent behind their words.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Aims to provide tailored suggestions by understanding product attributes, customer needs (e.g., "vegan," "for oily skin"), and even desired price points. The new "reason for match" feature will offer transparency, explaining *why* a product is suggested.
*   **Intuitive & Engaging Interface:** Recent UI enhancements include clear product cards with formatted USD pricing, helpful premade questions to kickstart conversations, and a smooth "typing" indicator for a natural chat flow.
*   **Robust & Scalable Foundation:** Built on a modern tech stack (Next.js, Vercel, Upstash Vector & Redis), ensuring reliability and the capacity to grow with Planet Beauty's needs.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Our iterative development process, backed by rigorous simulation testing, ensures we are constantly refining the AI's capabilities to meet and exceed customer expectations.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Key Milestones Achieved:
  ‚úÖ Core AI architecture (Google Gemini & Upstash Vector) successfully integrated.
  ‚úÖ Robust backend API for seamless chat processing and Shopify product sync.
  ‚úÖ Highly interactive and user-friendly chat interface featuring:
     ‚ú® Crystal-clear product cards with USD pricing.
     ‚ú® Innovative "reason for match" descriptions (pending full LLM rollout).
     ‚ú® Proactive premade questions to guide user discovery.
     ‚ú® Natural "typing" indicator for enhanced user experience.
  ‚úÖ Stable, lint-free codebase that builds successfully for production.
  ‚úÖ Comprehensive project documentation for transparency and maintainability.

End-to-End Simulation Test Status (User Interaction Scenarios):
  - Total Scenarios Tested: 16
  - Successfully Handled: 8 (50%)
  - Areas of Active Refinement: 8 (50%)
  - Current Strengths: Excels at greetings, general knowledge, basic product/attribute searches,
    multi-type queries, fictional item handling, and conversation memory.

The Path to Perfection - Our Commitment:
  - The current 50% success rate in complex simulations highlights that our foundational
    AI logic and simpler interactions are performing exceptionally well.
  - The remaining scenarios require fine-tuning our Large Language Model's (LLM)
    prompt engineering. This involves teaching the AI to more precisely:
    1. Determine the exact number of products to show (e.g., one specific item vs. a set).
    2. Interpret and apply price filters consistently.
    3. Handle specific brand/vendor queries with greater accuracy.
    4. Provide detailed, context-aware "reasoning" for every product suggestion.
  - Our dedicated team is focused on these refinements. We anticipate that a few
    more cycles of intensive prompt engineering and testing will elevate the AI's
    performance across all scenarios, solidifying its position as an industry-leading
    shopping assistant.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Development Status (As of May 11, 2025 - Early Morning Update)

This section summarizes recent development activities.

**UI/UX Enhancements & Fixes (May 11, Early Morning):**
*   **ESLint Configuration:** Updated `.eslintrc.json` to ignore `lib/upstash-vector-reference.ts`.
*   **Backend (`app/api/chat/route.ts`):**
    *   Product descriptions now aim to be "reasons for match" derived from LLM output (`product_matches`), replacing direct use of `textForBM25`.
    *   Reduced console noise by commenting out a verbose log and removing unused currency constants.
*   **Type Definitions (`lib/types.ts`):** Added `product_matches` to `LLMStructuredResponse`.
*   **Frontend Components & Styles:**
    *   `ProductCard.tsx`: Price prop is now a `number`, formatted as USD ($XX.XX). Description uses new `styles.productReasoning` class (gray, subtle, italic).
    *   `ChatInterface.tsx`: Displays 5 random premade questions on load.
    *   `ChatMessage.tsx`: Removed "Bella is thinking..." text. Price type updated in `Message` interface and `parseAdvice`.
    *   `ComplementaryProducts.tsx`: Corrected price prop type.
*   **Build & Linting:** All changes passed `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.

**Simulation Testing (`simulate-chat.ts` - as of May 11, after UI changes):**
*   **Current Status:** 8 out of 16 test cases PASSING (50%).
*   **Passing Highlights:** Greetings (Hi, Thanks), General Question (What is skincare?), Basic Product Search (vegan lipstick), Product Search with Attribute (serum for dry skin), Multiple Types (cleanser and moisturizer - count correct, products not ideal), No Results (fictional item), Memory Query, General Question (chatbot name).
*   **Outstanding Issues (from `simulate-chat.ts` - LLM Behavior):**
    *   **Price Filter Queries (e.g., "cheap sunscreen under $30"):** `ai_understanding` missing "price filter", `advice` missing "USD", `product_card` expected `true` but got 10 `complementary_products`.
    *   **Vendor Query ("Planet Beauty brand moisturizer"):** `product_card` expected `true`, but no products found.
    *   **Gibberish Handling ("asdfjkl;"):** `ai_understanding` ("gibberish input") not matching direct route response ("Unable to understand the query"), `advice` missing "more details".
    *   **Fallback Logic / Specific Attribute Query ("Any good eye creams for dark circles?"):** `ai_understanding` missing "dark circles", `product_card` expected `true` but got 10 `complementary_products`.
    *   **Complex Search (vegan, cruelty-free serum under $100):** Similar to price filter issues.
    *   **Set/Combo Counts:** "Skincare set for dry skin" (expected 3, got 10), "combo with cleanser and toner" (expected 2, got 1).
    *   **Follow-up Clarification ("Is that moisturizer part of a kit?"):** `advice` missing "kit".

**Previous Session (May 10, Evening - LLM Refinement Focus):**
*   **Product Price & Description Formatting (`app/api/chat/route.ts`):**
    *   Product prices in `ProductCardResponse` initially set to numbers (USD).
    *   Product descriptions initially truncated.
*   **Linting & Build Errors:** Initial fixes in various files.
*   **System Prompt Refinements (`lib/redis.ts` - `STATIC_BASE_PROMPT_CONTENT`):**
    *   Multiple iterations to improve LLM adherence to `requested_product_count`, price filter text, and specific examples.
    *   Refined `isPotentiallyGibberish` function in `app/api/chat/route.ts`.

## üí° Next Steps & Roadmap (Focus on LLM Behavior and Simulation Failures)

The immediate priority is to stabilize the LLM's behavior to pass all `simulate-chat.ts` tests.
1.  **LLM Prompt Engineering (`lib/redis.ts`) (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Update prompt to include `product_matches` with `reasoning` for each product.**
    *   **Simplify `requested_product_count` Rules:** The current prioritized list might be too complex. Try a simpler structure:
        1.  Handle non-product queries (count: 0).
        2.  Handle explicit lists ("show me X", "any Y", "top N Z") (count: 10 or N).
        3.  Handle "X and Y" / "combo" (count: 2).
        4.  Handle "set" (count: 3).
        5.  Default all other product queries to count: 1.
    *   **Reinforce Price Filter Output:** Use stronger keywords like "ALWAYS" for including "with price filter" in `ai_understanding` and "USD" in `advice`.
    *   **Specificity in `ai_understanding`:** For queries like "eye creams for dark circles", ensure the LLM includes all key attributes in the `ai_understanding`.

    *   **Specificity in `ai_understanding`:** For queries like "eye creams for dark circles", ensure the LLM includes all key attributes in the `ai_understanding`.
2.  **API Logic Review (`app/api/chat/route.ts`):**
    *   **Gibberish Check:** Re-evaluate `isPotentiallyGibberish` for "asdfjkl;" to ensure it's caught before LLM, or ensure LLM fallback for nonsense is robust.
    *   **Product Slicing for Complementary:** Ensure `finalProductCards.slice(0, requestedCount)` is correctly applied when `requestedCount` is > 1.
3.  **Data Verification (Medium Priority):**
    *   Verify product data for "Planet Beauty" vendor to ensure the "Planet Beauty brand moisturizer" test can pass if logic is correct.
4.  **Iterative Testing (`simulate-chat.ts`):**
    *   Run simulation after each significant prompt or logic change to track progress and regressions.

## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Serverless Functions on Vercel)
*   **AI - Language Model:** **Integrated external LLM (e.g., xAI Grok, OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini Pro/Flash via API)**
*   **AI - Vector Search:** Upstash Vector (for products and general knowledge base)
*   **Caching & Session Management:** Upstash Redis, LRUCache
*   **E-commerce Platform:** Shopify (Admin API - GraphQL, Storefront API)
*   **External Data:** Placeholder for real-time APIs (e.g., pricing, trends)
*   **Logging:** Pino
*   **Testing:** Jest, `ts-node` for simulation scripts

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Mechanisms

### AI & Search: Gemini and Upstash Vector (BM25)
The chatbot uses Google Gemini for intent recognition and Upstash Vector (BM25) for product search. The `app/api/chat/route.ts` API route manages this flow.

### Product Data Structure in Vector Store (Observed)
Analysis of data retrieved from Upstash Vector indicates the following typical structure for product metadata.

```json
{
  "textForBM25": "Jane Iredale ColorLuxe Hydrating Cream Lipstick, BLUSH Rich-yet-weightless...",
  "title": "Jane Iredale ColorLuxe Hydrating Cream Lipstick, BLUSH",
  "handle": "jane-iredale-colorluxe-hydrating-cream-lipstick-blush",
  "vendor": "jane iredale",
  "productType": "", // Often empty or generic like "Personal Care"
  "tags": ["beauty", "skincare"], // Often generic, may not contain specific attributes
  "price": "34.00", // Note: Prices are now assumed to be in USD.
  "imageUrl": "https://...",
  "productUrl": "/products/...",
  "variantId": "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/48182142828749"
  // "id" (Shopify Product GID) is also available from the vector query result itself.
}
```
**Key Observations for Search Logic:**
*   Specific `productType` is often not in the `productType` field. Filtering logic also checks the `title`.
*   Attributes are often found within `textForBM25`. Filtering logic also checks `textForBM25`.

### Shopify Integration
Product synchronization (`app/api/sync-products/route.ts`) populates the vector store. The chat API includes a Shopify GraphQL fallback (`performShopifyGraphQLQuery`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Deployment
(Setup and Deployment instructions remain largely the same as previous versions, focusing on cloning, `npm install`, `.env.local` configuration, and Vercel deployment.)

## üß™ Testing & Simulation
*   **Jest Unit Tests:** Continue development for new and refactored modules.
*   **Simulation (`simulate-chat.ts`):** Primary tool for E2E testing. Run with `node --loader ts-node/esm simulate-chat.ts`.

## üîë Environment Variables (Essential - Updated)
*   `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
*   `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN` (UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL is for presence check only)
*   **`GEMINI_API_KEY` (for the Google Gemini LLM)**
*   `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`, `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`
*   `MAX_CHAT_HISTORY` (optional, defaults to 10)
*   **`PRICE_API_KEY` (for hypothetical external price API)**
*   *(Potentially separate Vector credentials if using a different Upstash project for the knowledge base)*

## Troubleshooting Tips
*   **Product Search Failures:**
    *   Verify that the `productType` and `attributes` being filtered for exist in the expected fields of products in Upstash Vector.
    *   Verify that the `productType` and `attributes` being filtered for exist in the expected fields of products in Upstash Vector.
*   **Linting:** ESLint errors are actively being addressed. `lib/upstash-vector-reference.ts` is excluded from build checks.

## üìä Current Simulation Snapshot (May 11, 2025)

Our rigorous testing framework (`simulate-chat.ts`) currently shows the following:

*   **Overall Pass Rate:** 8 out of 16 test cases (50%)
*   **Key Strengths Demonstrated:**
    *   ‚úÖ Accurate handling of greetings and general chit-chat.
    *   ‚úÖ Correctly answering general knowledge questions (e.g., "What is skincare?").
    *   ‚úÖ Successful basic product searches (e.g., "vegan lipstick").
    *   ‚úÖ Effective attribute-based searches (e.g., "serum for dry skin").
    *   ‚úÖ Understanding queries for multiple product types (e.g., "cleanser and moisturizer" - count correct).
    *   ‚úÖ Graceful handling of requests for fictional/unavailable items.
    *   ‚úÖ Maintaining conversation context for memory-based queries.
*   **Areas for LLM Refinement (Next Focus):**
    *   üéØ Precision in `requested_product_count` for filtered single-item queries (currently returning lists).
    *   üéØ Consistent identification and use of price filters (missing "price filter" in `ai_understanding` and "USD" in `advice`).
    *   üéØ Accuracy in vendor-specific searches (currently not finding "Planet Beauty brand moisturizer").
    *   üéØ Robustness in handling edge-case/gibberish inputs (aligning `ai_understanding` with direct route response).
    *   üéØ Correct product counts for sets (e.g., "Skincare set for dry skin" expected 3, got 10) and combos (e.g., "cleanser and toner" expected 2, got 1).
    *   üéØ Nuanced follow-up clarification responses (e.g., missing "kit" in advice).
    *   üéØ LLM to provide detailed `reasoning` for each product in `product_matches`.
