## üõ†Ô∏è Current Development Status (As of May 10, 2025 - Evening Session Update)

This session focused on a major refactoring of the Chat API (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) and supporting libraries to integrate a more powerful, "Gemini-like" AI architecture.

*   **Key Architectural Enhancements Implemented:**
    *   **LLM Integration (`lib/llm.ts`):**
        *   Created a new module to abstract interactions with a powerful external Large Language Model.
        *   Includes a placeholder API client and `generateLLMResponse` function.
    *   **Enhanced System Prompt (`lib/redis.ts` - `STATIC_BASE_PROMPT_CONTENT`):**
        *   The system prompt has been completely rewritten to emulate a "Grok-like" personality ‚Äì clever, friendly, and witty.
        *   Includes more explicit instructions for handling complex queries, fictional products, and combo/set requests.
    *   **Chat History Summarization (`lib/redis.ts`):**
        *   Added `summarizeChatHistory` function, which uses the LLM to condense long chat histories, improving context retention.
    *   **General Knowledge Base Search (`lib/redis.ts`):**
        *   Added `searchKnowledgeBase` function and `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_INDEX_NAME` constant for querying a separate vector index for general beauty knowledge (currently a placeholder querying the product index).
    *   **External Data Integration (`lib/external.ts`):**
        *   Created a new module with a placeholder `fetchProductPrices` function to demonstrate fetching real-time external data.
    *   **Centralized Types (`lib/types.ts`):**
        *   Created a new file to store shared TypeScript type definitions (`ChatMessage`, `ChatHistory`, `LLMStructuredResponse`, etc.), ensuring consistency across modules.
    *   **Chat API Refactor (`app/api/chat/route.ts`):**
        *   The main API logic now uses `generateLLMResponse` for core AI processing.
        *   Integrates `summarizeChatHistory`, `searchKnowledgeBase`, and `fetchProductPrices` into the response generation flow.
        *   Updated to use the centralized types from `lib/types.ts`.
*   **Previous Simulation Issues Addressed (Structurally):**
    *   The new prompt and LLM integration aim to improve understanding of complex queries and fictional products.
    *   The refactored API structure provides hooks for more intelligent combo/set handling and knowledge base lookups.
    *   Detailed logging was added to `isPotentiallyGibberish` for better diagnostics.

## üí° Next Steps & Roadmap (Focus on New Architecture Configuration & Testing)

With the new architecture in place, the immediate priority is to configure and test its components.

1.  **LLM and External API Configuration (High Priority):**
    *   Replace placeholder API URLs and client logic in `lib/llm.ts` and `lib/external.ts` with actual implementations for the chosen LLM (e.g., xAI, OpenAI) and any external data services.
    *   Set up required environment variables (e.g., `XAI_API_KEY`, `PRICE_API_KEY`).
2.  **Knowledge Base Setup (High Priority):**
    *   Create and populate the `idx:beauty_knowledge` Upstash Vector index with relevant beauty articles, FAQs, and skincare tips.
    *   Ensure `searchKnowledgeBase` in `lib/redis.ts` can correctly query this new index (may require a separate `Index` client instance).
3.  **Product Search Filtering (Medium Priority):**
    *   Implement the `TODO` in `app/api/chat/route.ts` to filter product search results from Upstash Vector based on attributes, vendor, and price filters extracted by the LLM in `llmResult`.
4.  **Refine Combo/Set Logic with LLM (Medium Priority):**
    *   Leverage the LLM's improved understanding (via the new prompt) to better distinguish between requests for pre-packaged sets vs. assembling individual items for a combo. The `app/api/chat/route.ts` product search logic may need further adjustments based on the LLM's output for `product_types` and `requested_product_count`.
5.  **Iterative Testing & Simulation (`simulate-chat.ts`):**
    *   Thoroughly test the new architecture by running and expanding `simulate-chat.ts`.
    *   Update test expectations to align with the new Grok-style responses and enhanced capabilities.
    *   Pay close attention to the logs from `isPotentiallyGibberish` to diagnose any remaining issues with inputs like "asdfjkl;".
6.  **Unit Testing (Ongoing):**
    *   Develop Jest unit tests for the new modules (`lib/llm.ts`, `lib/external.ts`) and critical functions in the refactored `app/api/chat/route.ts`.

## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Serverless Functions on Vercel)
*   **AI - Language Model:** **Integrated external LLM (e.g., xAI Grok, OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini Pro/Flash via API)**
*   **AI - Vector Search:** Upstash Vector (for products and general knowledge base)
*   **Caching & Session Management:** Upstash Redis, LRUCache
*   **E-commerce Platform:** Shopify (Admin API - GraphQL, Storefront API)
*   **External Data:** Placeholder for real-time APIs (e.g., pricing, trends)
*   **Logging:** Pino
*   **Testing:** Jest, `ts-node` for simulation scripts

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Mechanisms

### AI & Search: Gemini and Upstash Vector (BM25)
The chatbot uses Google Gemini for intent recognition and Upstash Vector (BM25) for product search. The `app/api/chat/route.ts` API route manages this flow.

### Product Data Structure in Vector Store (Observed)
Analysis of data retrieved from Upstash Vector indicates the following typical structure for product metadata.

```json
{
  "textForBM25": "Jane Iredale ColorLuxe Hydrating Cream Lipstick, BLUSH Rich-yet-weightless...",
  "title": "Jane Iredale ColorLuxe Hydrating Cream Lipstick, BLUSH",
  "handle": "jane-iredale-colorluxe-hydrating-cream-lipstick-blush",
  "vendor": "jane iredale",
  "productType": "", // Often empty or generic like "Personal Care"
  "tags": ["beauty", "skincare"], // Often generic, may not contain specific attributes
  "price": "3400.0", // Note: Appears to be in Pesos (e.g., 3400.00 means ‚Ç±3400)
  "imageUrl": "https://...",
  "productUrl": "/products/...",
  "variantId": "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/48182142828749"
  // "id" (Shopify Product GID) is also available from the vector query result itself.
}
```
**Key Observations for Search Logic:**
*   Specific `productType` is often not in the `productType` field. Filtering logic also checks the `title`.
*   Attributes are often found within `textForBM25`. Filtering logic also checks `textForBM25`.

### Shopify Integration
Product synchronization (`app/api/sync-products/route.ts`) populates the vector store. The chat API includes a Shopify GraphQL fallback (`performShopifyGraphQLQuery`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Deployment
(Setup and Deployment instructions remain largely the same as previous versions, focusing on cloning, `npm install`, `.env.local` configuration, and Vercel deployment.)

## üß™ Testing & Simulation
*   **Jest Unit Tests:** Continue development for new and refactored modules.
*   **Simulation (`simulate-chat.ts`):** Primary tool for E2E testing. Requires updates for new response styles and capabilities. Run with `npx tsc --project tsconfig.json && node dist_sim/simulate-chat.js` (after temporarily setting `noEmit: false` in `tsconfig.json`).

## üîë Environment Variables (Essential - Updated)
*   `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
*   `UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL`, `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN` (for product index)
*   **`XAI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` (for the chosen LLM)**
*   `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`, `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`
*   `MAX_CHAT_HISTORY` (optional, defaults to 10)
*   **`PRICE_API_KEY` (for hypothetical external price API)**
*   *(Potentially separate Vector credentials if using a different Upstash project for the knowledge base)*

## Troubleshooting Tips
*   **Product Search Failures:**
    *   Verify that the `productType` and `attributes` being filtered for exist in the expected fields of products in Upstash Vector.
    *   Ensure price filters in `simulate-chat.ts` account for Pesos.
*   **TypeScript Errors:** A persistent TypeScript error related to boolean type inference for product query checks in `app/api/chat/route.ts` was a major challenge. It is now considered resolved following manual user edits and subsequent refactoring of the conditional logic.
