# Planet Beauty AI Chatbot: Intelligent Shopping Assistant

## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to the Planet Beauty AI Chatbot project! This isn't just a chatbot; it's an intelligent shopping assistant designed to revolutionize the online shopping experience for Planet Beauty customers. Built with cutting-edge AI and seamless e-commerce integration, this chatbot aims to provide personalized assistance, intelligent product recommendations, and instant answers, driving customer engagement and sales.

Our solution leverages the power of Google's Gemini API for sophisticated natural language understanding and Upstash Vector for lightning-fast, relevant product searches. Deep integration with Shopify ensures real-time product data accuracy and a smooth path from query to checkout.

## ‚ú® Key Features: Crafting the Ultimate Shopping Companion

*   **Sophisticated LLM-Powered Dialogue:** At its heart, our assistant uses **Google's Gemini API**, enabling it to understand not just words, but the *intent and context* behind complex customer queries. This allows for natural, flowing conversations and truly helpful, human-like advice.
*   **Intelligent Product Discovery:** Combines **Upstash Vector** for rapid semantic search with traditional filtering, ensuring customers find the right products quickly, even with vague or multifaceted requests.
*   **Unbreakable Context & Memory:** Features **enhanced contextual chat history management using Upstash Redis for session persistence**, remembering previous interactions within a session. For longer conversations, it intelligently uses **LLM-powered summarization** to maintain relevant context efficiently.
*   **Blazing-Fast & Responsive:** Leverages **efficient caching strategies with Upstash Redis** for API responses (reducing LLM calls for repeated queries) and session history, delivering swift responses and a smooth user experience.
*   **Adaptive & Relevant Interactions:** While not "learning" in a self-modifying AI sense, the system is designed for **continuous improvement through iterative prompt engineering and a dynamic Redis-based knowledge base**. The LLM's capabilities allow for responses that adapt to the evolving conversation. The knowledge base learns from interactions to provide faster, consistent answers to common non-product queries.
*   **Shopify GraphQL Fallback:** Guarantees product information availability, even if vector search yields no immediate results for highly specific edge cases.

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Development Status (As of May 12, 2025)

This section summarizes recent development activities.

**Caching & Knowledge Base Integration, Bug Fixes (May 11-12):**
*   **Redis Integration (`lib/redis.ts`):**
    *   Implemented functions for caching API responses (`cacheResponse`, `getCachedResponse`) with TTL.
    *   Implemented functions for session history management (`cacheSessionHistory`, `getSessionHistory`) with TTL, replacing older ephemeral history functions.
    *   Implemented dynamic knowledge base (`updateKnowledgebase`, `getKnowledgebaseEntry`) with basic keyword similarity search and TTL.
    *   Added `invalidateProductCaches` for use during product syncs.
    *   Corrected `STATIC_BASE_PROMPT_CONTENT` syntax issues and ensured `redisClient` is exported.
*   **API Endpoint Updates (`app/api/chat/route.ts`):**
    *   Integrated response caching: checks cache before calling LLM, caches new responses.
    *   Integrated session history: retrieves and stores chat history using new Redis functions.
    *   Integrated knowledge base update: stores relevant non-product Q&As.
    *   Fixed `userId` handling by ensuring it's passed from the frontend and processed correctly.
    *   Refined logic for handling `is_product_query` and `search_keywords` consistency, including better fallback mechanisms.
    *   Corrected import statements and variable usage (e.g., `redisClient` removal, `pino` import).
*   **LLM Logic (`lib/llm.ts`):**
    *   Integrated `getKnowledgebaseEntry` to check for existing answers before calling Gemini API.
    *   Enhanced fallback logic for JSON parsing errors to better align with `is_product_query` expectations and system prompt.
    *   Improved post-processing of LLM response for `is_product_query` consistency and vendor handling (Planet Beauty as a store).
    *   Replaced `console.log` with `pino` logger.
*   **Frontend (`components/ChatInterface.tsx`):**
    *   Added `userId` state (using `uuidv4`) and included it in API requests to `/api/chat`.
*   **Linting:** Addressed various linting errors across multiple files.

**Previous UI/UX Enhancements & Fixes (May 11):**
*   (Details from previous README section retained for context, e.g., ESLint, product description handling, suggested questions API)

**Simulation Testing (`simulate-chat.ts`):**
*   Updated `evaluateResponse` to better handle scenarios where the Upstash Vector index might be empty, preventing false negatives for product search tests.
*   **Current Status:** (To be re-evaluated after full testing of caching, knowledge base features, and recent bug fixes). The primary goal is to ensure the `is_product_query` bug is resolved and core LLM logic remains sound, with caching providing performance benefits.

## üí° Next Steps & Roadmap

1.  **Thorough Testing of Caching & Knowledge Base (Highest Priority):**
    *   Run Jest unit tests for Redis functions (e.g., `test/chatbot.test.ts` or `test/redis.cache.test.ts`).
    *   Execute `simulate-chat.ts` to verify core logic and test case pass rates.
    *   Manually test UI for cache hits, session persistence, and knowledge base interactions.
    *   Populate Upstash Vector `idx:products_vss` and test product search functionality.
    *   Verify Upstash connections using `curl` or similar tools if issues are suspected.
2.  **LLM Prompt Engineering (`lib/redis.ts`) (Ongoing High Priority):**
    *   Continue refining `STATIC_BASE_PROMPT_CONTENT` based on simulation results and manual testing to improve:
        *   Accuracy of `requested_product_count` for various query types.
        *   Consistent inclusion of price filter details in `ai_understanding` and `advice`.
        *   Handling of specific attribute queries and complex searches.
        *   Generation of `product_matches` with `reasoning`.
3.  **API Logic Review (`app/api/chat/route.ts`):**
    *   Further refine logic for when to update the knowledge base (e.g., based on response confidence or if no products were found but advice was given).
4.  **Data Verification & Population:**
    *   Ensure `idx:products_vss` is robustly populated via Shopify sync (e.g., using `app/api/sync-products/route.ts`).
    *   Monitor and curate `chat:knowledgebase:*` entries in Redis.

## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Serverless Functions on Vercel)
*   **AI - Language Model:** Google Gemini API (via `lib/llm.ts`)
*   **AI - Vector Search:** Upstash Vector (for products via `idx:products_vss`)
*   **Caching, Session & Knowledge Base:** Upstash Redis (for API responses, session history, dynamic knowledge base)
*   **E-commerce Platform:** Shopify (Admin API - GraphQL, Storefront API)
*   **External Data:** Placeholder for real-time APIs (e.g., pricing, trends)
*   **Logging:** Pino
*   **Testing:** Jest, `ts-node` for simulation scripts

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Mechanisms

### AI, Search, Caching & Knowledge Base
The chatbot uses:
*   **Google Gemini API (`lib/llm.ts`):** For natural language understanding, intent recognition, and generating conversational responses. Checks knowledge base first.
*   **Upstash Vector (`idx:products_vss`):** For semantic search of product data.
*   **Upstash Redis (`lib/redis.ts`):**
    *   **API Response Caching:** Stores responses to frequent queries to reduce LLM calls and speed up replies.
    *   **Session History:** Maintains conversation context for each user.
    *   **Dynamic Knowledge Base:** Stores common non-product questions and answers, learning from interactions to provide faster, consistent information.
The `app/api/chat/route.ts` API route manages this flow, prioritizing cached responses, then knowledge base lookups, then LLM generation.

### Product Data Structure in Vector Store (Observed)
Analysis of data retrieved from Upstash Vector indicates the following typical structure for product metadata.

```json
{
  "textForBM25": "Jane Iredale ColorLuxe Hydrating Cream Lipstick, BLUSH Rich-yet-weightless...",
  "title": "Jane Iredale ColorLuxe Hydrating Cream Lipstick, BLUSH",
  "handle": "jane-iredale-colorluxe-hydrating-cream-lipstick-blush",
  "vendor": "jane iredale",
  "productType": "", // Often empty or generic like "Personal Care"
  "tags": ["beauty", "skincare"], // Often generic, may not contain specific attributes
  "price": "34.00", // Note: Prices are now assumed to be in USD.
  "imageUrl": "https://...",
  "productUrl": "/products/...",
  "variantId": "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/48182142828749"
  // "id" (Shopify Product GID) is also available from the vector query result itself.
}
```
**Key Observations for Search Logic:**
*   Specific `productType` is often not in the `productType` field. Filtering logic also checks the `title`.
*   Attributes are often found within `textForBM25`. Filtering logic also checks `textForBM25`.

### Shopify Integration
Product synchronization (`app/api/sync-products/route.ts`) populates the vector store. The chat API includes a Shopify GraphQL fallback (`performShopifyGraphQLQuery`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Deployment
(Setup and Deployment instructions remain largely the same as previous versions, focusing on cloning, `npm install`, `.env.local` configuration, and Vercel deployment.)

## üß™ Testing & Simulation
*   **Jest Unit Tests:** Continue development for new and refactored modules.
*   **Simulation (`simulate-chat.ts`):** Primary tool for E2E testing. Run with `node --loader ts-node/esm simulate-chat.ts`.

## üîë Environment Variables (Essential - Updated)
*   `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
*   `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN` (UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL is for presence check only)
*   **`GEMINI_API_KEY` (for the Google Gemini LLM)**
*   `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`, `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`
*   `MAX_CHAT_HISTORY` (optional, defaults to 10)
*   **`PRICE_API_KEY` (for hypothetical external price API)**
*   *(Potentially separate Vector credentials if using a different Upstash project for the knowledge base)*

## Troubleshooting Tips
*   **Product Search Failures:**
    *   Verify that the `productType` and `attributes` being filtered for exist in the expected fields of products in Upstash Vector.
    *   Verify that the `productType` and `attributes` being filtered for exist in the expected fields of products in Upstash Vector.
*   **Linting:** ESLint errors are actively being addressed. `lib/upstash-vector-reference.ts` is excluded from build checks.
