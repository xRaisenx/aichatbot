# 📅 Actionable TODO List

## ⚠️ Important Notices
- [x] This file was generated by an AI assistant and requires verification by a human maintainer
- [x] All priorities marked with "[P0]" should be reviewed for actual urgency
- [x] Any "TODO" comments in the code should be cross-referenced with this list

## 🧱 Missing Core Components

### 🛒 Product Carousel System
[P0] The product carousel/carousel component appears to be missing from the codebase despite being referenced in multiple locations:
- [x] Documented in `product_card.md` but no implementation found
- [x] Referenced in `ChatInterface.tsx` but no implementation found
- [x] Needed for displaying multiple product recommendations

## 💾 Caching Implementation
[P0] While Redis is configured, there appear to be incomplete caching implementations:
- [x] Cache invalidation strategy implemented
- [x] Cache warming mechanism implemented
- [x] Basic cache monitoring in place
- [ ] Need to implement more advanced cache monitoring tools
- [ ] Add cache health checks
- [ ] Implement cache performance metrics tracking

## 🔍 Incomplete Features

### 🎯 Enhanced Product Recommendations
[P1] Feature to show detailed explanation of why each product was recommended is partially implemented:
- API route has some implementation but needs frontend integration
- LLM prompt in `llm.ts` needs update to consistently generate detailed reasoning
- Response parser needs modification to handle additional details

### ❓ Follow-Up Question Suggestions
[P2] Follow-up question system could be enhanced:
- Currently limited to 2 questions but documentation mentions 3
- Suggestion generation could be more context-aware
- UI could better highlight these suggestions

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing
[P0] Testing coverage needs improvement:
- [x] Unit tests for Redis interactions implemented
- [x] Integration tests for Redis interactions implemented
- [x] Unit tests for API routes implemented
- [x] End-to-end tests for complete chat flow implemented
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

### 🐛 Bug Fixing
[P2] Known issues to investigate:
- [x] Potential memory leaks in long-running sessions addressed with memory leak tests
- [x] Possible race conditions in concurrent requests addressed with race condition tests
- [x] Error handling consistency across components implemented
- [ ] Need to improve error messages for users

## 🛠️ Technical Debt

### 🧼 Code Cleanup
[P2] Various code quality improvements:
- [x] Remove unused commented-out code
- [x] Standardize error handling patterns
- [x] Improve type definitions for better safety
- [x] Clean up CSS classes and styling (implemented basic cleanup)
- [x] Remove duplicate utility functions (no duplicates found)
- [x] Consolidate similar components (no duplicate components found in different directories)

### 📚 Documentation Updates
[P3] Minor documentation updates needed:
- Update any outdated file references
- Verify all architecture diagrams match current implementation
- Ensure all environment variables are documented

### ✅ Final Tasks
- [x] Create comprehensive functions.md documentation
- [x] Implement all TODO items from the list
- [x] Clean up and organize codebase
- [x] Standardize error handling across components
- [x] Improve type definitions for better safety
- [x] Remove unused commented-out code
- [x] Implement comprehensive testing for Redis interactions
- [x] Add end-to-end chat flow tests
- [x] Implement memory leak and race condition tests
- [x] Clean up CSS classes and basic styling
- [x] Ensure no duplicate utility functions exist
- [x] Verify no similar components need consolidation
