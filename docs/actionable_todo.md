[2025-05-14] - Fixes and Enhancements
Fixed

Removed Duplicate LLMStructuredResponse Type:

Eliminated redundant LLMStructuredResponse definition in lib/types.ts to resolve type conflicts causing issues in the project. The primary definition, including optional history, product_card, and complementary_products fields, was retained for compatibility with lib/llm.ts and lib/redis.ts.
No new variables or logic changes introduced, ensuring minimal impact on existing functionality.


Resolved next.config.js Linting Error:

Fixed SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export' during npm run lint by converting next.config.js from ES module syntax (export default) to CommonJS (module.exports).
Ensured compatibility with the project's CommonJS setup, avoiding the need for a full ES module migration, which could disrupt dependencies like distilgpt2 and Gemini providers.



Added

New Caching Functions in lib/redis.ts:
Implemented cacheResponse and getCachedResponse functions to cache and retrieve ChatApiResponse objects in Redis, using the chat:response: prefix and a 7-day TTL.
Aligned with existing cacheResponse signature by using ChatApiResponse instead of LLMStructuredResponse, ensuring type consistency and avoiding new variables.
Added JSON serialization (`JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`) for Redis compatibility and logging with pino to match existing style.



Changed

Updated lib/types.ts:

Streamlined type definitions by removing the duplicate LLMStructuredResponse, preserving all other interfaces (ChatApiResponse, ChatMessage, etc.) unchanged.


Updated lib/redis.ts:

Integrated new caching functions without altering existing logic, prefixes (chat:response:, chat:session:, etc.), or TTLs (e.g., 10-minute RESPONSE_TTL for original cacheResponse).
Maintained compatibility with Upstash Redis and existing providers (distilgpt2, Gemini).

Updated lib/llm.ts:

Implemented LLM-based keyword generation for vector search with fallback logic.

Notes

Deployment:

Changes tested locally and prepared for deployment to Vercel and Hugging Face Spaces (https://xraisenx-chat-bot.hf.space).
Instructions provided for committing changes, redeploying, and testing /api/chat endpoint and Redis caching.


Future Considerations:

Consider unifying the original and new cacheResponse functions if a single caching approach is preferred.
Monitor for potential ES module migration if project requirements shift, though CommonJS is currently stable.

# Actionable TODO List: Prioritized and Sequenced

This document outlines the steps needed to maintain and improve the Planet Beauty AI Chatbot project, ensuring a comprehensive and up-to-date view of the project, while prioritizing tasks for sequential development to minimize risks.

## Goal

To ensure the Planet Beauty AI Chatbot project is complete, maintainable, scalable, and AI-friendly, with a clear roadmap for future development.

## Development Principles

*   **Sequential Development:** Tasks are prioritized and sequenced to minimize the risk of breaking existing functionality. Lower-risk tasks are tackled first to build a stable foundation.
*   **Prioritization:** Tasks are prioritized based on their impact on the project's core functionality, maintainability, scalability, and AI-friendliness.
*   **Documentation First:** Before starting any major development task, ensure that the existing code and project structure are well-documented.

## Prioritized TODO Items

### Phase 1: Foundation and Stability (Completed)
(Details omitted for brevity - no changes)

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancement and AI Integration (Completed)
(Details omitted for brevity - no changes)

### Phase 3: Scalability, Optimization, and Refinement (Largely Completed, Ongoing Refinements - As of May 17, 2025)
(Details for items 1-24 omitted for brevity - no changes)

25. [ ] **Verify All Unit Tests (Critical Priority, Stability):**
    *   **Status (as of May 17, 2025):**
        *   `test/shopify.test.js`: Passing.
        *   `test/api/sync-products/route.test.ts`: Skipped.
        *   `test/app/api/chat/route.test.ts`: Expanded with new tests for contextual intents and GraphQL fallback. TypeScript errors resolved.
        *   `test/chat.test.js`, `test/lib/redis.cache.test.js`, `test/gemini.test.js`: Reset to placeholder tests. Need rebuilding. Unit tests for `lib/redis.ts` (prompt caching) are pending.
    *   **Next Steps (High Priority):** Incrementally rebuild remaining unit tests.
26. [x] **Update all relevant documentation (High Priority, Maintainability):**
    *   `README.md`, `progress.md`, `actionable_todo.md`, `feedback.md`, and `project_structure.md` updated to reflect recent changes.
27. [x] **Chat Interface UI Enhancements (High Priority, Feature):** (Completed)
    *   Implemented Product Recommendations as a Chatbox Product Carousel.
    *   Implemented Prevent Autoscroll on Chatbot Reply.
    *   Implemented Clear Chat and History.
    *   Implemented New Conversation Functionality.
    *   Limited Follow-up Questions to 2.

    *   Conditional Pro Tip Display (Skipped due to implementation issues).
    *   Removed Clear Chat button from ChatInterface.

### Phase 3.5: Full Product Synchronization (On Hold)
(Details omitted for brevity - no changes)

### Phase 3.7: Verification Checks (Completed - New Issues Identified)
(Details omitted for brevity - no changes)

### Phase 4: New Architecture Implementation, Caching & Refinement (Ongoing - May 17, 2025)

*   **Goal:** Implement, configure, and refine the new "Gemini-like" AI architecture (`gemini-1.5-flash` model), integrate Redis caching and dynamic knowledge base, pass all simulation tests in `simulate-chat.ts`, implement requested UI/UX enhancements, and ensure code quality.
*   **Work Done This Session (May 17):**
    *   Fixed module not found error in `components/ProductCarousel.tsx`.
    *   Addressed linting errors in `components/ChatMessage.tsx`.
