## üí° Next Steps & Roadmap

1.  **Thorough Testing of Caching & Knowledge Base (Highest Priority):**
    *   Run Jest unit tests for Redis functions (e.g., `test/chatbot.test.ts` or `test/redis.cache.test.ts`).
    *   Execute `simulate-chat.ts` to verify core logic and test case pass rates.
    *   Manually test UI for cache hits, session persistence, and knowledge base interactions.
    *   Populate Upstash Vector `idx:products_vss` and test product search functionality.
    *   Verify Upstash connections using `curl` or similar tools if issues are suspected.
2.  **LLM Prompt Engineering (`lib/redis.ts`) (Ongoing High Priority):**
    *   Continue refining `STATIC_BASE_PROMPT_CONTENT` based on simulation results and manual testing to improve:
        *   Accuracy of `requested_product_count` for various query types.
        *   Consistent inclusion of price/attribute filters in `ai_understanding` and `USD` in `advice`.
        *   Handling of specific attribute queries and complex searches.
        *   Generation of `product_matches` with `reasoning`.
3.  **API Logic Review (`app/api/chat/route.ts`):**
    *   Further refine logic for when to update the knowledge base (e.g., based on response confidence or if no products were found but advice was given).
4.  **Data Verification & Population:**
    *   Ensure `idx:products_vss` is robustly populated via Shopify sync (e.g., using `app/api/sync-products/route.ts`).
    *   Monitor and curate `chat:knowledgebase:*` entries in Redis.

## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Serverless Functions on Vercel)
*   **AI - Language Model:** Google Gemini API (via `lib/llm.ts`)
*   **AI - Vector Search:** Upstash Vector (for products via `idx:products_vss`)
*   **Caching, Session & Knowledge Base:** Upstash Redis (for API responses, session history, dynamic knowledge base)
*   **E-commerce Platform:** Shopify (Admin API - GraphQL, Storefront API)
*   External Data: Placeholder for real-time APIs (e.g., pricing, trends)
*   Logging: Pino
*   Testing: Jest, `ts-node` for simulation scripts

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Mechanisms

### AI, Search, Caching & Knowledge Base
The chatbot uses:
*   **Google Gemini API (`lib/llm.ts`): For natural language understanding, intent recognition, and generating conversational responses. Checks knowledge base first. The LLM is also used to generate keywords for vector search.
*   **Upstash Vector (`idx:products_vss`):** For semantic search of product data.
*   **Upstash Redis (`lib/redis.ts`):**
    *   **API Response Caching:** Stores responses to frequent queries to reduce LLM calls and speed up replies.
    *   **Session History:** Maintains conversation context for each user.
    *   **Dynamic Knowledge Base:** Stores common non-product questions and answers, learning from interactions to provide faster, consistent information.
The `app/api/chat/route.ts` API route manages this flow, prioritizing cached responses, then knowledge base lookups, then LLM generation.

### Product Data Structure in Vector Store (Observed)
Analysis of data retrieved from Upstash Vector indicates the following typical structure for product metadata.

```json
{
  "textForBM25": "Jane Iredale ColorLuxe Hydrating Cream Lipstick, BLUSH Rich-yet-weightless...",
  "title": "Jane Iredale ColorLuxe Hydrating Cream Lipstick, BLUSH",
  "handle": "jane-iredale-colorluxe-hydrating-cream-lipstick-blush",
  "vendor": "jane iredale",
  "productType": "", // Often empty or generic like "Personal Care"
  "tags": ["beauty", "skincare"], // Often generic, may not contain specific attributes
  "price": "34.00", // Note: Prices are now assumed to be in USD.
  "imageUrl": "https://...",
  "productUrl": "/products/...",
  "variantId": "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/48182142828749"
  // "id" (Shopify Product GID) is also available from the vector query result itself.
}
```
**Key Observations for Search Logic:**
*   Specific `productType` is often not in the `productType` field. Filtering logic also checks the `title`.
*   Attributes are often found within `textForBM25`. Filtering logic also checks `textForBM25`.

### Shopify Integration
Product synchronization (`app/api/sync-products/route.ts`) populates the vector store. The chat API includes a Shopify GraphQL fallback (`performShopifyGraphQLQuery`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Deployment
(Setup and Deployment instructions remain largely the same as previous versions, focusing on cloning, `npm install`, `.env.local` configuration, and Vercel deployment.)

## üß™ Testing & Simulation
*   **Jest Unit Tests:** Continue development for new and refactored modules.
*   **Simulation (`simulate-chat.ts`):** Primary tool for E2E testing. Run with `node --loader ts-node/esm simulate-chat.ts`.

## üîë Environment Variables (Essential - Updated)
*   `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
*   `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` (UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL is for presence check only)
*   **`GEMINI_API_KEY` (for the Google Gemini LLM)**
*   `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`, `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`
*   `MAX_CHAT_HISTORY` (optional, defaults to 10)
*   **`PRICE_API_KEY` (for hypothetical external price API)**
*   *(Potentially separate Vector credentials if using a different Upstash project for the knowledge base)*

## Troubleshooting Tips
*   **Product Search Failures:**
    *   Verify that the `productType` and `attributes` being filtered for exist in the expected fields of products in Upstash Vector.
    *   Verify that the `productType` and `attributes` being filtered for exist in the expected fields of products in Upstash Vector.
*   **Linting:** ESLint errors are actively being addressed. `lib/upstash-vector-reference.ts` is excluded from build checks.
