## 🛒 Product Card Component System

The product card system is central to displaying products to users in an engaging way.

### 🧱 Component Structure

#### Single Product Display
When displaying a single product, the [ProductCard](components/ProductCard.tsx) component is used directly. It shows:
- Product image
- Title and description
- Price information ($USD format)
- Availability status (in stock, out of stock, low stock)
- Action buttons for viewing product details and adding to cart

#### Multiple Products Display
For multiple products, two different approaches are used:

1. **Product Carousel** - For horizontal scrolling of products
2. **Product Comparison** - For side-by-side comparison of product features

### 📦 File Locations
- `components/ProductCard.tsx` - Main product card implementation
- `components/ProductCarousel.tsx` - Carousel implementation for multiple products
- `components/ProductComparison.tsx` - Side-by-side product comparison view

### 🧩 Props Interface

``typescript
interface ProductCardProps {
  title: string; // Product title/name
  description: string; // Short description of the product
  price: number; // Product price in USD
  image: string | null; // URL to product image
  landing_page: string; // Link to product detail page
  matches?: string; // Optional match percentage if used in comparisons
  onAddToCart?: (productId: string, productTitle: string) => void; // Add to cart handler
  productId?: string; // Unique identifier for the product
  availableForSale?: boolean; // Whether product is in stock
  quantityAvailable?: number; // How many items are available (if applicable)
}
```

### 🎨 Styling

Styling is implemented using CSS Modules from `ChatInterface.module.css` with the following classes:

| Class Name         | Purpose                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| .productCard       | Main container styling           |
| .productImage      | Image container and styling      |
| .productInfo       | Container for text information   |
| .productTitle      | Title text styling               |
| .productDescription| Description text styling         |
| .productPrice      | Price text styling               |
| .addToCartButton   | Base button styling              |
| .viewProductPink   | Pink variant of the button       |
| .outOfStock        | Out of stock indicator           |
| .lowStock          | Low stock indicator              |

### 🛠️ Getting Started Guide

#### Step 1: Import Required Components
At the top of your file, add these lines to import the necessary components:

```tsx
// Import both ProductCard and ProductCarousel
import { ProductCard } from '@/components/ProductCard';
import { ProductCarousel } from '@/components/ProductCarousel';
```

#### Step 2: Prepare Your Product Data
Below the imports but above the component definition, add your product data. Here's an example with two products:

```tsx
// Example product data
const products = [
  {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Luxury Skincare Cream',
    description: 'Premium anti-aging cream with natural ingredients',
    price: 49.99,
    image: '/images/skincare-cream.jpg',
    landing_page: '/products/1',
    availableForSale: true,
    quantityAvailable: 15
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    title: 'Hydrating Face Serum',
    description: 'Deep hydration formula with hyaluronic acid',
    price: 34.99,
    image: '/images/face-serum.jpg',
    landing_page: '/products/2',
    availableForSale: true,
    quantityAvailable: 8
  }
];
```

You can customize this data with your own products:
- Change the `id` to match your product ID
- Update `title` and `description` with your product name and details
- Modify `price` to reflect your pricing
- Replace `image` with the path to your product image
- Set `landing_page` to where you want users to go when they click the product
- Adjust `availableForSale` and `quantityAvailable` based on your inventory

#### Step 3: Create the Add to Cart Function
Add this function to handle adding items to the cart:

```tsx
// Function that runs when someone clicks "Add to Cart"
const handleAddToCart = async (productId: string, productTitle: string) => {
  try {
    // This is where we would connect to your shopping cart system
    // For now, it just shows a message in the browser
    alert(`Added ${productTitle} to cart!`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding to cart:', error);
    alert('Failed to add product to cart');
  }
};
```

This function will show a message when someone clicks "Add to Cart". In a real store, this would connect to your shopping cart system.

#### Step 4: Add the Product Display Code
Find where the component returns JSX (it will look like `return (` or `return <>`) and replace it with this code:

```tsx
return (
  <div className="product-display">
    {/* This section shows either one product or a carousel */}
    {products.length === 1 ? (
      // This shows a single product
      <ProductCard 
        {...products[0]} 
        onAddToCart={handleAddToCart} 
        productId={products[0].id} 
      />
    ) : (
      // This shows multiple products in a carousel
      <ProductCarousel 
        products={products} 
        onAddToCart={handleAddToCart} 
      />
    )}
  </div>
);
```

This code tells the application to show either one product or a carousel based on how many products you have in your list.

### 🎨 Customizing Appearance

If you want to change how the product cards look without writing CSS, you can use TailwindCSS classes directly on the component. Here's how:

```tsx
<ProductCard
  title="Styled Product"
  description="This product has custom styling"
  price={39.99}
  image="/custom-style.jpg"
  landing_page="/product/custom"
  // These classes change the appearance
  className="border-2 border-pink-500 hover:shadow-lg"
/>
```

You can use any TailwindCSS classes here to customize the appearance:
- `border-2` makes the border thicker
- `border-pink-500` gives it a pink border
- `hover:shadow-lg` adds a shadow when someone hovers over the card

### 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

Once you've added all the code, you can test it by:

1. **Single Product Test** - Remove one product from the list and check if it shows a single card
2. **Multiple Products Test** - Keep both products to see the carousel
3. **Add to Cart Test** - Click the "Add to Cart" button and ensure it shows the message
4. **Availability Test** - Change `availableForSale` to false to see the "Out of Stock" message
5. **Low Stock Test** - Set `quantityAvailable` to 3 to see the "Low Stock" message

### 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | What to Check | How to Fix |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Products not showing | Are you rendering the component? | Make sure the return statement includes the ProductCard or ProductCarousel |
| Wrong product images | Are image paths correct? | Verify image URLs match your assets |
| Add to Cart not working | Is handleAddToCart connected? | Ensure the function is properly defined and passed to the component |
| Prices not formatted correctly | Is price a number? | Make sure price values are numbers, not text |
| Out of Stock message not showing | Are availability props set? | Check availableForSale and quantityAvailable values |

### 🧠 Best Practices

1. **Keep Product Data Consistent** - Use the same format for all products
2. **Use Clear Image Names** - Name images according to what they show
3. **Organize Your Products** - Group similar products together
4. **Test on Different Devices** - Check how it looks on phones, tablets, and desktops
5. **Get Feedback** - Show it to colleagues to get input on usability

   - Handles communication with Google Gemini API
   - Manages prompt templates and formatting
   - Processes raw LLM output into structured responses
   - Implements rate limiting and retry logic

2. **Vector Search Service (lib/upstash-vector-reference.ts)**
   - Interfaces with Upstash Vector for semantic product search
   - Transforms LLM-generated keywords into search queries
   - Handles result ranking and filtering
   - Implements fallback mechanisms for edge cases

3. **Redis Service (lib/redis.ts)**
   - Manages caching of frequent queries
   - Stores and retrieves conversation history
   - Implements dynamic knowledge base
   - Handles session persistence

4. **Shopify Integration Service (lib/shopify.ts)**
   - Synchronizes product data from Shopify
   - Implements GraphQL queries for product lookup
   - Provides fallback mechanism when vector search fails

5. **API Endpoints (app/api/***)
   - `/chat/route.ts` - Main chat endpoint handling the complete request lifecycle
   - `/sync-products/route.ts` - Product synchronization endpoint
   - `/settings/route.ts` - Configuration management endpoint

### 🔄 Request Processing Flow

1. **Request Reception** - The `/chat/route.ts` endpoint receives the user's message
2. **Cache Check** - First checks for cached responses for identical or similar queries
3. **Knowledge Base Check** - Consults Redis-stored knowledge base for common non-product queries
4. **LLM Processing** - If no cache hit, sends to LLM for understanding and response generation
5. **Product Search** - If product query detected, performs vector search with LLM-generated keywords
6. **Response Assembly** - Combines LLM response with product results (if any)
7. **Caching** - Stores successful responses for future use
8. **Return Response** - Sends final response back to the client

### 🧠 LLM Prompt Engineering

The system uses a sophisticated prompt template that includes:

- Instructions for role and behavior
- Knowledge base content
- Conversation history
- Query analysis requirements
- Response formatting guidelines

Prompt engineering is an ongoing process to improve:
- Accuracy of requested product count
- Consistent inclusion of price/attribute filters
- Handling of specific attribute queries
- Generation of detailed reasoning for product suggestions

### 🧭 Navigation

The chat interface maintains navigation state to allow users to:
- Go back to previous messages
- Navigate forward after going back
- Maintain context during navigation

## 🖥️ Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with Next.js App Router and follows modern React best practices for state management and component organization.

2. **CSS Modules** - Scoped styles for component-specific styling needs
3. **Design Tokens** - Centralized color, spacing, and typography definitions
4. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at:
   - sm: 640px
   - md: 768px
   - lg: 1024px
   - xl: 1280px

### 📱 Responsive Behavior

The interface adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile View (<640px)**: Full-screen chat with simplified controls
- **Tablet View (640-1024px)**: Adjusted layout for better thumb reach
- **Desktop View (>1024px)**: Expanded view with more visible content

### 🧠 State Management

State is managed using a combination of techniques:

1. **React Context API** - For global state like theme preferences
2. **Component State** - For local UI state within components
3. **Session Storage** - For persisting temporary state between sessions
4. **Server-Side Session** - For maintaining conversation history across requests

### 🔄 Real-Time Updates

The chat interface implements real-time updates through:

1. **Streaming Responses** - Partial responses appear as they're generated
2. **WebSocket Fallback** - For reliable connection during long responses
3. **Polling Mechanism** - For checking status of long-running operations

## 🛒 Shopify Integration (Set Aside)
