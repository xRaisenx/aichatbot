    *   Refined `isPotentiallyGibberish` function. (Completed May 10)
    *   Ensured hardcoded gibberish response matches test expectations. (Completed May 10)
    *   **[New - May 11]** Refined product description handling to use "reason for match" from LLM (via `product_matches` field).

*   **[x] Simulation Testing (`simulate-chat.ts`):** Used extensively for iterative debugging. (Ongoing from May 10)
*   **[x] Iterative Debugging:** Multiple rounds of simulation, log analysis, and code/prompt fixes. (Ongoing from May 10)
*   **[New - May 11] [x] ESLint Configuration Update (`.eslintrc.json`):** Ignored `lib/upstash-vector-reference.ts`.
*   **[New - May 11] [x] UI/UX Enhancements (Components & Styles):**
    *   `ProductCard.tsx`: Implemented USD price formatting (e.g., "$43.00"), changed `price` prop to `number`. Updated description to use new `styles.productReasoning` class.
    *   `styles/ChatInterface.module.css`: Added `.productReasoning` style (gray, subtle, italic).
    *   `ChatInterface.tsx`: Expanded `suggestedQuestions` and now displays 5 random premade questions.
    *   `ChatMessage.tsx`: Removed "Bella is thinking..." text. Updated `Message` interface for `product_card.price` to be `number` and ensured `Number()` conversion in `parseAdvice`.
    *   `ComplementaryProducts.tsx`: Corrected `price` prop passed to `ProductCard` to be a `number`.
*   **[New - May 11] [x] Build and Lint Success:** Ensured `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass after all May 11 changes.
*   **[New - May 11] Simulation Run (Post UI Changes):**
    *   `simulate-chat.ts` run: 8 out of 16 test cases PASSING.
