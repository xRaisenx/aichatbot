[2025-05-14] - Fixes and Enhancements
Fixed

Removed Duplicate LLMStructuredResponse Type:

Eliminated redundant LLMStructuredResponse definition in lib/types.ts to resolve type conflicts causing issues in the project. The primary definition, including optional history, product_card, and complementary_products fields, was retained for compatibility with lib/llm.ts and lib/redis.ts.
No new variables or logic changes introduced, ensuring minimal impact on existing functionality.


Resolved next.config.js Linting Error:

Fixed SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export' during npm run lint by converting next.config.js from ES module syntax (export default) to CommonJS (module.exports).
Ensured compatibility with the project's CommonJS setup, avoiding the need for a full ES module migration, which could disrupt dependencies like distilgpt2 and Gemini providers.



Added

New Caching Functions in lib/redis.ts:
Implemented cacheResponse and getCachedResponse functions to cache and retrieve ChatApiResponse objects in Redis, using the chat:response: prefix and a 7-day TTL.
Aligned with existing cacheResponse signature by using ChatApiResponse instead of LLMStructuredResponse, ensuring type consistency and avoiding new variables.
Added JSON serialization (JSON.stringify/JSON.parse) for Redis compatibility and logging with pino to match existing style.



Changed

Updated lib/types.ts:

Streamlined type definitions by removing the duplicate LLMStructuredResponse, preserving all other interfaces (ChatApiResponse, ChatMessage, etc.) unchanged.


Updated lib/redis.ts:

Integrated new caching functions without altering existing logic, prefixes (chat:response:, chat:session:, etc.), or TTLs (e.g., 10-minute RESPONSE_TTL for original cacheResponse).
Maintained compatibility with Upstash Redis and existing providers (distilgpt2, Gemini).



Notes

Deployment:

Changes tested locally and prepared for deployment to Vercel and Hugging Face Spaces (https://xraisenx-chat-bot.hf.space).
Instructions provided for committing changes, redeploying, and testing /api/chat endpoint and Redis caching.


Future Considerations:

Consider unifying the original and new cacheResponse functions if a single caching approach is preferred.
Monitor for potential ES module migration if project requirements shift, though CommonJS is currently stable.
