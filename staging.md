To create a visually appealing and client-friendly version of the Planet Beauty AI Chatbot staging process, I’ll enhance the previous artifact with emojis to represent progress, maintain a professional yet engaging tone, and incorporate real dates from our conversation history (April 8, 2025, to May 9, 2025). The document will use a clean structure, progress indicators (e.g., ✅, 🚀), and visual flair to impress a client. The staging process will remain consistent with the previous response, but I’ll add emojis and adjust the formatting for clarity and appeal. The timeframe will be updated to reflect a start date of May 26, 2025, as previously outlined, with real past dates for context.
